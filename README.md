5. **Removing Elements:** Use the remove method to delete an element at a specific index or by providing the object reference.

# Stack

The Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle dictates that the element that was most recently inserted is also the element that is removed first. A stack is a linear data structure that follows this rule. It employs the commands "push" and "pop" to add elements to the stack and, accordingly, remove the top element from the stack. The "peek" technique additionally enables Access to the top element without removing it.

**Features of a stack:**

1. **LIFO behavior:** The last element pushed onto the stack is the first one to be popped out, making it suitable for applications where the order of insertion and removal is important.
2. **Limited Access:** Stacks typically provide restricted Access to elements. You can only access the topmost element, and to reach other elements, you need to pop the elements above them.
3. **Dynamic size:** Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists, allowing for a dynamic size. They can grow or shrink as needed during runtime.

**Advantages:**

1. **Simplicity:** Stacks are easy to understand and implement.
2. **Efficiency:** Insertion and deletion operations have a time complexity of O(1).
3. **Function call management:** Stacks efficiently manage function calls and variable storage.
4. **Undo/Redo functionality:** Stacks enable undo and redo operations in applications.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Limited Access:** Access to elements is restricted to the top of the stack.
2. **Size restrictions:** Stacks may have size limitations depending on the implementation.
3. **Not suitable for all scenarios:** Stacks are specific to LIFO behavior and may not be appropriate in other cases.

2. **Dequeue:** Removing an element from the front of the queue.
3. **Peek:** Retrieve the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
4. **Size:** Determining the number of elements in the queue.
5. **Empty Check:** Checking if the queue is empty.

**Advantages:**

1. **FIFO Behavior:** Elements are processed in the order of their insertion, ensuring the preservation of the original sequence.
2. **Efficient Insertion and Removal:** Adding and removing elements from a queue is fast and has a constant time complexity of O(1).
3. **Synchronization:** Java provides synchronized queue implementations, making them safe for concurrent programming.
4. **Standardized Interface:** The Queue interface in Java offers a common set of methods, allowing easy interchangeability between different queue implementations.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **No Random Access:** Queues do not support direct Access to elements in the middle. Accessing specific positions requires dequeuing preceding elements.
2. **Limited Size:** Some queue implementations have a fixed size or capacity, leading to overflow or exceptions when exceeding the maximum size.
3. **Inefficient Search:** Searching for an element in a queue requires dequeuing until a match is found, resulting in a linear search with potentially high time complexity.
